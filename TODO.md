# Tools... #

It would be great to have a bit more than 3 tools...

# Dependencies #

For now only aptitude dependencies are handled.
It would be great to be able to handle dependencies such as CPAN.

# Path expansion #

The current system is great but what about perl script, python script
or even jar files like burp ?

# Packages #

The package system aims to give users another level of customization over tools.
For example, a custom installation directory, custom symlink and so on.
It would also be cool to be able to download things such as wordlists.

# Configuration files #

What about downloading configuration files from a repository/whatever to
automatically apply the configuration to an installed tool ?
Obviously, this would go in the package section.

# Minor changes #

  * There are still FIXME in the code
  * The logFile of Configuration should be defined in core_config
